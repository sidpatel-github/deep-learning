# deep-learning

Deep Learning is gaining much popularity due to itâ€™s supremacy in terms of accuracy when trained with huge amount of data. This project 
provides various models developed using neural network.

Regression as well as Classification models are developed with minimal use of libraries in this project.

This project is implemented using Python and some of it's libraries like numpy, matplotlib etc.
